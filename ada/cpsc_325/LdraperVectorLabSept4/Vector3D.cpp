// ADT Vector3D:
//    data object Vector3D is a point or vector in xyz coordinate system. Just like in mathematics,
//       whether the 3 coordinate values describe a point or describe a vector will depend on the context.
//    data structure; 3 doubles for the x, y, z coordinates
//    operations: creates, copy, destroys, assigns,
//                vector space operations of unary minus; binary addition, compound addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication (on the right),
//                Also, dot product, cross product, division by a scalar (on the right),
//                Distance between two points and the square of such distance,
//                normalize a vector and return the normalization of a vector,
//                find the length of a vector
